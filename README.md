# This is a Alarm Clock project
It is a project for a connected Alarm clock, with agenda, weather indications, and much more. I do it for fun, with a raspberry pi 0W, and a low power consumption EPaper 800\*480px with 7.3inches.

Futur plans are :
- Music alarm
- wifi off the night
- auto reboot the midnight to evoid bugs (maybe, will see)
- temperature inside
- second button to manage alarm activity
