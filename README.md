# This is a Alarm Clock project
It is a project for a connected Alarm clock, with agenda, weather indications, and much more. I do it for fun, with a raspberry pi 0W, and a low power consumption EPaper 800\*480px with 7.3inches.

Futur plans are :
- [x] Music alarm
- [ ] Wifi off the night (abandoned)
- [ ] Auto reboot the midnight to evoid bugs (maybe, will see)
- [ ] Temperature inside (abandoned)
- [x] Second button to manage alarm activity
- [ ] Configuration file
